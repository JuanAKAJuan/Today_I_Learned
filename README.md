Today I Learned is a website that allows people to submit their own facts and react to other people's facts. This project was built using React for the front-end and Supabase for the back-end. People can react to posts and view them based on their topics like Science, Technology and Finance. In order for a post to be submitted, it has to have a source, category and the fact itself.
